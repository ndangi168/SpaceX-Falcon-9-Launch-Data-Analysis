## Project Background and Objectives

SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, has revolutionized the aerospace industry with its Falcon 9 rocket. This project recognizes the importance of analyzing Falcon 9 launch data, which includes launch details, payload information, landing outcomes, and more. The objectives of this analysis are as follows:

- Provide a comprehensive overview of Falcon 9 launches.
- Explore the performance and reliability of Falcon 9 rockets.
- Analyze mission outcomes, including successful landings and payloads delivered.
- Visualize key insights to facilitate a better understanding of SpaceX's achievements.

## Data Collection

Data for this project was collected from two primary sources:

1. **SpaceX API:**
   - Data was obtained by making GET requests to SpaceX API endpoints.
   - Information related to launches, rockets, payloads, and landing outcomes was collected.
   - Data was decoded from JSON responses and transformed into structured pandas dataframes.

2. **Web Scraping Wikipedia:**
   - Falcon 9 launch records were extracted from Wikipedia using web scraping techniques.
   - HTML tables containing launch data were parsed and converted into pandas dataframes.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved several steps to ensure data quality and consistency:

- Handling missing values.
- Cleaning and formatting data for analysis.
- Combining data from the SpaceX API and Wikipedia sources.
- Ensuring data types are appropriate for analysis.
